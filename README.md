# Research @ Nationwide-Children's-Hospital
## Overview
- Research focus is on understanding how the spatial organization of immune and tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment correlates with cancer progression and treatment response
- Datasets came from published papers on high-resolution spatial single-cell imaging of brain, lung, and head/neck tumor tissues
- Developed python algorithms to map out cell slides, cluster immune cells (CD8+ cells), and perform statisitcal analysis of cluster count, responder vs non-responder, etc
- Currently drafting a research paper to be submitted to a journal

## Tools Used
- Python (PyCharm)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Statsmodel, Sci-Learn, Scipy.io
 
## Code Walkthrough

- Mapping out cell sides is essential to asses the structures and cell types present. Cell coordinates need to be extracted in the correct manner in order to achieve accurate results. In certain datasets such as the Brain and Lung Tumor the cell coordinates are encoded through lattice correlations (describe what lattice correlations are).

- Taking a deeper dive into the response of immune cells (Immune cells also go by either CD8+ or T-Cells), we cluster any immune cells within 30 Î¼m of each other (Explain significance of clustering from paper), the plot is shown below.
